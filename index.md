  This inserts the "about" photo and text from `_config.yml`.
  You can edit it there (jekyll needs restart!) or remove it and provide your own photo/text.
  Don't forget to add the `me` class to the photo, like this: `![alt](src){:.me}`.

Hi there! My name is Yuan "Andrea" Gao. I am a Dukie in [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and an aspiring Chinese calligraphist.

I am enthusiastic about application of Bayesian Statistics, Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing in different fields.

The appreciation of art, fashion, literature, and different cultures governs my life. And I enjoy jogging, cycling and traveling a lot.

I am looking for more experiences and adventures.
