I"m<p>            I went to <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)</a> yesterday, and it was my second time to visit there in this summer.</p>

<p>            When I was at Berkeley in 2014, SFMOMA was under construction. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get into SFMOMA, and at the beginning of 2015, I visited MOMA in New York City. After a three-year-long expansion, SFMOMA reopened on May 14, 2016, and it happened that I am in the Bay Area now.</p>

<p>            Among numerous impressive arts in SFMOMA, <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/99.352" target="_blank"><em>Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance</em></a> by <a href="Ellsworth Kelly" target="_blank">Ellsworth Kelly</a> stood out as a surprise for me. Since it was painted by oil on gridded wood, and Kelly arranged color for each square by totally chance to avoid his own influence on the art.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>            Coincidently, this paint reminded me of a project I did last semester, <a href="/gytcrt.github.io/_posts/2016-05-02-topic-modeling-with-latent-dirichlet-allocation.html" target="_blank">Topic Modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a>. My teammate and I implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and tried to discover latent topics among documents in a corpus. At the end of our project, we visualized the result to test our implementation, and the visualization looks very similar to Kelly’s work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>            Suddenly, I felt there is no boundary between art and science, maybe we can even try to discover the probability distribution of how Kelly picked the colors. Appreciation grows.</p>
