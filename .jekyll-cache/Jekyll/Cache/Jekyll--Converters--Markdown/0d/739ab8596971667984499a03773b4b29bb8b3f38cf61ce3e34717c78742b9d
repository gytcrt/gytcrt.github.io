I"Ü<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Finally, I set up my first personal website. The idea occurred to me at the beginning of 2016, but it took me some time to explore and find a way to accomplish it. Actually, it was quite an adventurous and rewarding mission, because I was not an expert in stuff like HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I visited a lot of personal websites of professors, data scientists, software engineers and designers, and researched some popular web-hosting services, before I started. I decided to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Page</a> to generate and host the website, because they are free and flexible.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The theme is stolen from <a href="https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack" target="_blank">Hydejack</a> and <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde" target="_blank">Hyde</a></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Itâ€™s thanks to many peopleâ€™s effort that I could build this website.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Here are some useful resources Iâ€™ve learned from:</p>
