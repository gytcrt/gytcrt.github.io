Finally, I set up my first personal website. The idea occurred to me at the beginning of 2016, but it took me some time to explore and find a way to accomplish it. Actually, it was quite an adventurous and rewarding mission, because I was not an expert in stuff like HTML and CSS.

I visited a lot of personal websites of professors, data scientists, software engineers and designers, and researched some popular web-hosting services, before I started. I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} to generate and host the website, because they are free and flexible.

The theme is stolen from [Hydejack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack){:target="_blank"} and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde){:target="_blank"}

It's thanks to many people's effort that I could build this website.

Here are some useful resources I've learned from:

* [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/){:target="_blank"}
* [Jekyll Blog Gallery](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites){:target="_blank"}
* [Jekyll Template](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/){:target="_blank"}
* [Markdown Syntax Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet){:target="_blank"}
